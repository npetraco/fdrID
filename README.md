# fdrID 

R package to compute local false discovery rates (posterior error probabilities)for machine learning classification/discrimination tasks. Still under development but this public version is functional. We will add connection to Stan and spline fit smoothing next. 

Breifly, to install: devtools()::install_github("fdrID", username="npetraco"). More extensive install instructions comming soon. If you need help, email me.

  For  Source  Identification  Via Computer Matching Systems,” (To be submitted)
